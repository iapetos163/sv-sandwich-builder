# Pokémon S/V Sandwich Calculator

A tool to calculate sandwich recipes for Pokémon Scarlet/Violet.
Input a meal power, and this tool will attempt to find a
recipe that yields that power.

Created using [PDMLab/vite-react-typescript-tailwind-starter](https://github.com/PDMLab/vite-react-typescript-tailwind-starter).

Uses data and code derived from [cecilbowen/pokemon-sandwich-simulator](https://github.com/cecilbowen/pokemon-sandwich-simulator).

This project is still very much a work in progress! [Contributions are welcome](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Feature Roadmap

These features are planned for future releases
(so please don't open an Issue to request them):

* **Recipes for more than one power**
* Include predetermined sandwich recipes in the results
* Include restaurant meals in the results
* Note when any kind of Herba Mystica will work for a recipe
* Multiplayer sandwiches
