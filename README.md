# Pokémon S/V Sandwich Calculator

A tool to calculate sandwich recipes for Pokémon Scarlet/Violet.
Input one or more meal powers, and this tool will attempt to find a
sandwich recipe that yields those powers.

Created using [PDMLab/vite-react-typescript-tailwind-starter](https://github.com/PDMLab/vite-react-typescript-tailwind-starter).

Uses data and code derived from [cecilbowen/pokemon-sandwich-simulator](https://github.com/cecilbowen/pokemon-sandwich-simulator).

## Feature Roadmap
