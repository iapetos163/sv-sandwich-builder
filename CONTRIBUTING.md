## Incorrect or missing recipes

Please note that if too many ingredients fall off while making a sandwich
in the game, then the resulting meal powers may differ from the expected ones.

If the tool says there isn't a recipe for a query, but there actually is one,
please include the correct recipe in your issue.

If the recipe output is incorrect, please include the actual results from that recipe.
Screenshots or video from the game would be ideal.
