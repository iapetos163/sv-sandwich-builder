# Contributing Guidelines

Issues and Pull Requests are welcome!

Before opening an Issue, please review the guidelines below.

## Feature Roadmap

These features are planned for future releases
(so please don't open an Issue to request them):

* Include restaurant meals in the results
* Note when any kind of Herba Mystica will work for a recipe
* Multiplayer sandwiches

## Incorrect or missing recipes

Please note that if too many ingredients fall off while making a sandwich
in the game, then the resulting meal powers may differ from the expected ones.

If the tool says there isn't a recipe for a query, but there actually is one,
please include the correct recipe in your issue.

If the recipe output is incorrect, please include the actual results from that recipe.
Screenshots or video from the game would be ideal.
